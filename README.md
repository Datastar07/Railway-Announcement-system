# Indian-Railway-Announcement-system

### Prerequisite: The prerequisite of this project is the basic knowledge of python.

### How it works and get the output?
For creating railway announcement software, we will be using a bunch of modules like **pyaudio**, **pydub**, and **gTTS** to process audio and get the announcing status of thousands of trains. By using **PyAudio** module, we can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms. **Pydub** is a simple and well-designed Python module for audio manipulation and **gTTS** (which stands for Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate text-to-speech API.

In which we are adding the **train name** , **train no.** , **platform no.**,etc into the [announcement.xlsx][identifier] and this excel file pass into the [main.py][idetifier2] file and this python code is generate the announcement for each and every train which are present in the [announcement.xlsx] file.

After successfully Running this [main.py] python script it generate the all train's audio file inform of **announcement_Train-no.mp3** (Audio) files.
